Moodle filter which converts text between [%   %] to easychem chemical
structures and formulas. The original filter was created by Carl LeBlond
using easychem.js library by Peter Win. This updated version supports Moodle 4.5+
and uses easychem.js successor, charchem2.js (charchem.org).

Note: This filter was designed to be used with the Easychem
Atto Editor (moodle-atto_easychem).  You should install it after
this for best results.

3) Proceed to the notifications section of the admin panel.
4) Confirm installation of moodle-filter_easychem
5) Proceed to Site administration > Plugins > filters > manage filters and activate the filter.
